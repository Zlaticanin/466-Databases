        <h2>Overview of the Three Computer Science Emphases</h2>

        <h3>Software Development</h3>
        <p>Concentrates only on computer science classes, taking three elective courses within the department.<br />
           Software Development majors are well-prepared for software development careers in virtually any industry.</p>

        <h3>Enterprise Software</h3>
        <p>Requires CSCI 465: Enterprise Application Environments. Extra-departmental requirements include three business courses.<br />
           An Enterprise Software major typically programs business applications and is well-posiitoned to start an MBA degree program<br /> 
           or move into management later in their carreer. Additionally, an Enterprise Software major is well-positioned to get a<br /> 
           Minor in Business Administration or a Minor in Business Innovation and Entrepreneurship, as the required business courses along<br /> 
           with well-chosen general education courses may double-dip to help satisfy those minors. For the Entrepreneurship Minor, we recommend<br /> 
           that you contact the Entrpreneurship Minor advisor in the Department of Management as soon as you decide to puruse that minor.</p>

        <h3>Computational Software</h3>
        <p>Requires CSCI 401: Theory of Computation. Extra-departmental requirements include a course in physics, at least seven mathematical courses,<br />
            and a calculus-based statistics course. The Computational Emphasis requirements also satisfy the requirements for a minor in Mathematics after<br />
            the student declares it with the Department of Mathematics. Some will double major in Mathematics instead. A Computational Software major<br />
            generally goes on to graduate school or takes a position in mathematical programming, such as in research or in Actuarial Sciences.</p>
